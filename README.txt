Thank your for the interest in "The Path"!
It is a small "Chose your own story" game set in the Indian tropical dry forest, created for a university course.
Disclaimer: This is for personal use only, do not distribute in any form.


Installation instructions for Windows (currently there are no instructions for Mac or Linux. The process should be similar)


The game is designed to be run in Jupyter Notebook, if you already have access to Jupyter Notebook, skip the installation.

Jupyter Notebook installation:
Please download and install anaconda navigator (https://www.anaconda.com/)
After successful installation launch Anaconda Navigator. In order to do so, type "Anaconda Navigator" in the searchbar on your PC and start the app.
In the app launch Jupyter Notebook. It should be opened in your browser.


Setting up the game:
Download all files from the github repostory and unpack the zip-files with the images
Within Jupyter, create a new folder by clicking on "New" in the top right corner and selecting "Folder". 
The name for this folder does not affect the game, so chose a name of your liking (If you struggle with decisions, just name it "The Path")
Open the new folder and copy all the files (all images, ThePath_v2.py) into it (drag and drop is recommended). Make sure to hit "upload" for all the files, as they will not be uploaded otherwise.
Important: Do not upload folders in the new folder, only single files!


Starting the game:
Open the file "ThePath.ipynb" and execute the cell with crtl + enter.
If you run into any issues, check if the cell is formatted as "code".
If your cell or notebook is completely corrupted, paste

%run game_v2.py
game()

into a new cell (possibly in a new notebook within the new folder).


Have fun :)
